# Challenge from Frontend Mentor

###  This is the challenge *[Stats preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62)*.

### This is *[my Solution](https://stats-preview-card-component-three-mu.vercel.app/)*.

This challenge into a lot new things to me and things that I have already saw in some tutorials but I didn't explore them before. The manage of image color(it's new and I know that isn't the same of the template), how handle(really) with the flex directions, how to set different size for others device, try to understand better the proprieties of padding and margin,... I had a difficult to recognize the specific size of the template, because of this the project is bigger than the design and some properties has set with other values. A previous challenge I received a tip how to use BEM and DOM, I'm learning both yet but I think it's better than challenge before. If someone have some advice to improve this project, I will be so grateful. And if is possible, give me some feedback about my English too, isn't my main language and I would like know the mistakes.

#### THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING THIS SPACE TO EXPRESS MY SOLUTION OR DIFFICULTIES IN WORDS AND I WILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT NEW IDEAS AND LAYOUTS/TEMPLATES TO ORGANIZE THIS BETTER.
